In this project, a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) is implemented on MATLAB, along with its output waveform and RMS values.

A phase-locked loop (PLL) is an electronic circuit with a voltage or voltage-driven oscillator that constantly adjusts to match the frequency of an input signal. PLLs are used to generate, stabilize, modulate, demodulate, filter, or recover a signal from a "noisy" communications channel where data has been interrupted.

The main goal of a PLL is to synchronize the output oscillator signal with a reference signal. Even if the two signals have the same frequency, their peaks and troughs may not occur in the same place. Simply put, they do not reach the same point on the waveform at the same time.

Known as the phase difference, this is measured as the angle between the signals. For signals with varying frequencies, the phase difference between them will always vary, which means that one signal will lag or lead the other by a varying amount.
